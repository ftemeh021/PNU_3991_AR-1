  \textbf{\emph{Solution} :}

\textbf{\emph{Step I} :} Assume that $L$ is regular. Let $n$ be the number of states of the FA accepting $L$ .

\textbf{\emph{Step II} :} Let $w$ = $0^{n} 1^{2n} $, where $ n \geq 1 $ . $|$ $w$ $|$ = $ 3n >n $. By using the pumping lemma, we can write

$$ w = xyz, with \; w = xyz \; with | xy | \leq n \; and \; | y | > 0 . $$

\textbf{\emph{Step III} :} We want to find a suitable \; i\; so that $xy^{i}z$ $\notin$ $L$ . The string consists of ‘0’ and ‘1’. y can be any of the following forms

1. y consists of only ‘0’, and let $y = 0^{k}$

2. y consists of only ‘1’, and let $y = 1^{k}$

3. y consists of both ‘0’ and ‘1’, and let $y = 0^{k} 1^{k}$


For case $I$ , take $i = 0$ .

$$ w = xyz = 0^{n} 1^{2n}= 0^{n-k} 0^{k} 1^{2n} $$
$$ xy^{0}z = 0^{n-k} 1^{2n} , as \; k \neq 0 , (n-k)\neq n $$

For case $II$ , take $i = 0$ .

$$ w = xyz = 0^{n} 1^{2n}= 0^{n} 1^{k} 1^{2n-k} $$
$$ xy^{0}z = 0^{n} 1^{2n-k} , as \; k \neq 0 , (2n-k)\neq n $$

For case $III$ , take $i = 2$ .

$$ w = xyz = 0^{n} 1^{2n}= 0^{n-k} 0^{k} 1^{k} 1^{2n-k} $$
$$ xy^{2}z = 0^{n} 1^{k} 0^{k} 1^{2n} , \textsl{which is not in the form}\; 0^{n} 1^{2n}$$

For all the three cases, we are getting contradictions and, therefore, $L$ is not regular.

  A set is closed (under an operation) if and only if the operation on two elements of the set produces
another element of the set. If an element outside the set is produced, then the operation is not closed .
